Identify the Week Range:

The schedule always starts on Sunday (e.g., “Sun 10/12”).

The first listed day is the Sunday date — ignore all Sunday entries.

Only include Monday through Saturday lessons.

Extract the Following Data for Each Lesson:

Date (e.g., “October 13”)

Time Start (e.g., “7:00 AM”)

Time Finish (e.g., “8:30 AM”)

Class Category (e.g., “Adult Tennis”, “Youth Tennis”, “Tennis Academy”)

Class Name (e.g., “Shot of the Week: Groundstrokes”, “Academy”, “Speed Doubles”)

Duration — automatically calculated from the start and finish times, in hours, rounded to two decimals.

Filtering Rules:

Skip all Sunday events.

Exclude any entries labeled “Unavailable” or “Attended but not registered”.

Only include classes in Adult Tennis, Youth Tennis, or Tennis Academy.

🧮 Output Format

Display the results as a neatly formatted Markdown table exactly like this:

October 13	5:00 PM	6:00 PM	Adult Tennis	Shot of the Week: Groundstrokes	1.00

📦 If multiple PDFs are uploaded:

Process each file separately and label clearly with a heading:

Week of October 6–11, 2025
